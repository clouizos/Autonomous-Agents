Executing a specific policy in the simulator requires running that policy first in the policy package. Every implementation of a policy 
,ie VIPolicy.java (except PolicyEval~, RandomPolicy~), will output a policy.data file from the state-actions calculated within that policy, 
which contains the lookup table Q(s,a) and thereby the policy for the predator to execute. 
Executing that specific policy in the simulator requires an uncomment.

TLDR:

Step 1: execute policy.PolicyToExecute for a policy.data.
Step 2: uncomment said policy in simulator.
Step 3: run simulator!
